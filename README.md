About the Project :-

This project is a clock-based alarm system that allows users to set alarms at their desired times. One of the key features of this project is that it utilizes local storage in the user's browser, ensuring that if the tab or entire window is accidentally closed, the set alarm is not lost. When the user revisits the page, they will find the alarm settings preserved exactly as they left them. Additionally, the project remembers the last time an alarm was set by the user, making it convenient and user-friendly.
